// /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccuFfZTE.o: in function RCObject::RCObject()': test2.cpp:(.text+0x0):
// multiple definition of RCObject::RCObject()'; /tmp/ccEghkfG.o:test.cpp:(.text+0x0):
// first defined here

// GitHub Copilot
// The error message indicates that there are multiple definitions of the RCObject::RCObject()
// constructor function, with one definition in test.cpp and another in test2.cpp. The linker
//  /usr/bin/ld is complaining that it cannot determine which definition to use.

// When compiling C programs, the compiler first preprocesses the source code and header files,
//  expanding any macros and including any header files. The preprocessed code is then compiled
//   into object files, which contain machine code and symbols. Finally, the linker combines
//    the object files into an executable program, resolving any symbols and references between
//     them.

// In this case, it seems that both test.cpp and test2.cpp include the RCObject.h header file,
//  which defines the RCObject class and its constructor. This results in multiple definitions
//   of the constructor function, causing the linker error. To fix this, you can either remove
//    the constructor definition from one of the source files, or move it to a separate
//     implementation file and link it with both source files.

// here's a brief overview of the compilation process for C++ programs:

// Preprocessing: The preprocessor reads the source code and processes any preprocessor
// directives, such as #include statements and macro definitions. The output of this step
// is a modified source code file.

// Compilation: The compiler reads the preprocessed source code and generates object code
// for each source file. This involves translating the source code into machine code that
// can be executed by the computer.

// Linking: The linker combines the object code files into a single executable file.
// It resolves any references to external symbols, such as functions and variables defined
//  in other source files or libraries.

// Optimization: The optimizer analyzes the generated code and applies various
// transformations to improve its performance, such as removing redundant code and
// inlining functions.

// Output: The final output of the compilation process is an executable file that can be
// run on the target platform.

// During the compilation process, the compiler also performs various checks to ensure
// that the code is valid and free of errors. For example, it checks for syntax errors,
// type errors, and undefined symbols. If any errors are found, the compilation process
// will fail and the compiler will output an error message.

// Summary: Requiring or Prohibiting Heap-Based Objects
// ================================================================================

// The chapter "Requiring or Prohibiting Heap-Based Objects" from the book "More
// Effective C++" discusses how to design classes that require or prohibit heap-
// based objects. The chapter covers the following topics:

// - The difference between stack-based and heap-based objects
// - The use of private constructors and destructors to prevent heap-based objects
// - The use of reference-counting to allow heap-based objects
// - The use of smart pointers to manage heap-based objects
// - The use of the "envelope-letter" idiom to allow heap-based objects with
//   controlled access

// The chapter provides guidelines for designing classes that require or prohibit
// heap-based objects, and explains the advantages and disadvantages of each
// approach. The chapter also provides examples of how to implement each approach,
// and discusses the trade-offs involved in each case.

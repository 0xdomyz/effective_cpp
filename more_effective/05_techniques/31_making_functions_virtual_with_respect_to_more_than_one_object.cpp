// Summary: Making Functions Virtual with Respect to More Than One Object
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

// The chapter "Making Functions Virtual with Respect to More Than One Object"
// from the book "More Effective C++" discusses the use of multiple inheritance and
// virtual inheritance to make functions virtual with respect to more than one
// object. The chapter covers the following topics:

// - The motivation for making functions virtual with respect to more than one object
// - The use of multiple inheritance to achieve virtuality with respect to more than one object
// - The use of virtual inheritance to avoid the diamond problem in multiple inheritance
// - The performance implications of multiple inheritance and virtual inheritance
// - The use of dynamic_cast to determine the type of an object in a multiple inheritance hierarchy

// The chapter provides guidelines for designing and implementing classes that use
// multiple inheritance and virtual inheritance, and explains the advantages and
// disadvantages of each approach. The chapter also provides examples of how to use
// multiple inheritance and virtual inheritance, and discusses common pitfalls and
// best practices for using these features.

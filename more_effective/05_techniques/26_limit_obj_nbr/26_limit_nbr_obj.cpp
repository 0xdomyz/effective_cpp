// Summary: Limiting the Number of Objects of a Class
// --------------------------------------------------

// The chapter "Limiting the Number of Objects of a Class" from the book "More
// Effective C++" discusses techniques for limiting the number of objects that can
// be created from a class. The chapter covers the following topics:

// - The motivation for limiting the number of objects of a class
// - The use of private constructors to prevent object creation
// - The use of static member functions to control object creation
// - The use of the Singleton pattern to ensure only one object of a class is created
// - The use of the Monostate pattern to ensure all objects of a class share the same state
// - The use of the Object Pool pattern to limit the number of objects of a class that can be created

// The chapter provides guidelines for choosing the appropriate technique for a
// given scenario, and explains the advantages and disadvantages of each technique.
// The chapter also provides examples of how to use each technique, and discusses
// common pitfalls and best practices for limiting the number of objects of a class.

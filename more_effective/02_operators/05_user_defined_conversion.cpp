// In C++, user-defined conversion functions can be used to implicitly convert objects
// of one type to another type. While this can be useful in some cases, it can also lead
// to unexpected behavior and errors if not used carefully.

// One reason to be wary of user-defined conversion functions is that they can be used
// to perform implicit type conversions that may not be intended or desirable. For
// example, consider a class that represents a temperature in Celsius:

#include <iostream>

class Celsius
{
public:
    Celsius(double temp) : temperature(temp) {}
    operator double() const { return temperature; }

private:
    double temperature;
};

// This class defines a user-defined conversion function that allows objects of type
// Celsius to be implicitly converted to double. While this can be convenient in some
// cases, it can also lead to errors if the conversion is not intended. For example,
// consider the following code:

void printTemperature(double temp)
{
    std::cout << "Temperature: " << temp << " degrees Celsius\n";
}

int main()
{
    Celsius celsiusTemp(25.0);
    printTemperature(celsiusTemp);
    return 0;
}

// In this code, the printTemperature function expects a double argument, but is passed
// an object of type Celsius. Because Celsius defines a user-defined conversion function
// to double, the object is implicitly converted to double before being passed to the
// function. However, this can lead to unexpected behavior if the conversion is not
// intended or if the conversion is lossy.

// Another reason to be wary of user-defined conversion functions is that they can make
// code harder to read and understand. When a user-defined conversion function is used,
// it may not be immediately clear what type of object is being passed or returned. This
// can make it harder to reason about the behavior of the code and can lead to errors.

// In general, it is best to use user-defined conversion functions sparingly and only
// when they provide a clear benefit. If a conversion is needed, it is often better to
// use an explicit conversion function or constructor to make the conversion more
// explicit and avoid unexpected behavior.

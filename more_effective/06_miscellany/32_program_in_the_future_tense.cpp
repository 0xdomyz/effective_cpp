// Summary: Program in the Future Tense
// -------------------------------------

// The chapter "Program in the Future Tense" from the book "More Effective C++"
// discusses the importance of designing code with future changes in mind. The
// chapter covers the following topics:

// - The motivation for designing code with future changes in mind
// - The use of virtual functions to allow for future extensions
// - The use of non-member functions to allow for future extensions
// - The use of templates to allow for future extensions
// - The use of the Pimpl idiom to hide implementation details and allow for future changes
// - The use of version numbers to manage changes to interfaces

// The chapter provides guidelines for designing code that is flexible and
// extensible, and explains the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The
// chapter also provides examples of how to use each technique, and discusses
// common pitfalls and best practices for designing code with future changes in mind.

// Summary: Understand How to Combine C++ and C in the Same Program
// ----------------------------------------------------------------

// The chapter "Understand How to Combine C++ and C in the Same Program" from the
// book "More Effective C++" discusses the techniques for combining C++ and C code
// in the same program. The chapter covers the following topics:

// - The differences between C and C++ code
// - The use of extern "C" to declare C functions in C++ code
// - The use of C++ classes in C code
// - The use of C++ templates in C code
// - The use of C++ exceptions in C code
// - The use of C++ namespaces in C code

// The chapter provides guidelines for designing and implementing programs that
// combine C++ and C code, and explains the advantages and disadvantages of each
// approach. The chapter also provides examples of how to use each technique, and
// discusses common pitfalls and best practices for combining C++ and C code in the
// same program.

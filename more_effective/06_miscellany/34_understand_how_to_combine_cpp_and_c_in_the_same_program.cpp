If you want to mix C++ and C in the same program, remember the following simple guidelines:
■ Make sure the C++ and C compilers produce compatible object
files.
■ Declare functions to be used by both languages extern "C".
■ If at all possible, write main in C++.
■ Always use delete with memory from new; always use free with
memory from malloc.
■ Limit what you pass between the two languages to data structures
that compile under C; the C++ version of structs may contain nonvirtual member functions.

// Summary: Remember the 80-20 Rule
// ---------------------------------

// The chapter "Remember the 80-20 Rule" from the book "More Effective C++"
// discusses the importance of focusing on the most important aspects of a program
// and optimizing them, rather than trying to optimize everything. The chapter
// covers the following topics:

// - The motivation for focusing on the most important aspects of a program
// - The use of profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks
// - The use of algorithmic improvements to optimize performance
// - The use of data structure improvements to optimize performance
// - The use of low-level optimizations to optimize performance
// - The trade-offs between performance and maintainability

// The chapter provides guidelines for identifying the most important aspects of a
// program and optimizing them, and explains the advantages and disadvantages of
// each approach. The chapter also provides examples of how to use each technique,
// and discusses common pitfalls and best practices for optimizing program
// performance while maintaining code quality.

// In C++, the 80-20 rule states that 80% of the execution time of a program is spent
// in 20% of the code. This means that optimizing the critical 20% of the code can
// have a significant impact on the overall performance of the program.

// The 80-20 rule is based on the observation that most programs spend a large amount
// of time in a small number of functions or loops. By identifying and optimizing these
// critical sections of code, it is possible to achieve significant performance gains
// without having to optimize the entire program.

// For example, consider a program that performs a large number of matrix multiplications.
// If the program spends 80% of its time in the matrix multiplication function, optimizing
// this function can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the program.

// However, it is important to note that optimizing the critical 20% of the code is not
// always the best approach. In some cases, optimizing less critical code can have a greater
// impact on the overall performance of the program. It is important to carefully analyze
// the performance characteristics of the program and identify the sections of code that
// are most critical to its performance.

// In addition, it is important to consider the trade-offs between performance and other
// factors such as maintainability, readability, and portability. Optimizing code for
// performance can sometimes make it more difficult to understand and maintain, and can
// make it less portable to different platforms and architectures.

// In summary, the 80-20 rule is a useful guideline for identifying critical sections of
// code that can be optimized to improve the performance of a program. However, it is
// important to carefully analyze the performance characteristics of the program and
// consider the trade-offs between performance and other factors when optimizing code.
